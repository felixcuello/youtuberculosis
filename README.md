## Motivation

The main motivation for this project is that I bought a pair of headphones for swimming. Some bone
conduction headphones, but the huge problem with this type of headphones is that they only stream
MP3 or similar audio and I since 2015 or so, I haven't listened to MP3 anymore. Thanks to the audio
streaming platforms.

So I need to find a workaround to get some MP3, just for me, to listen to music while swimming.

This is just a proof of concept to see if I can get audio for my headphones and use them just for
swimming purposes (since I can't use a 25/50mts cable to swim around in a pool while listening to
music).
